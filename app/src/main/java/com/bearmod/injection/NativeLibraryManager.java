/**
 * NativeLibraryManager
 *
 * Minimal stub manager responsible for coordinating native library loading
 * for BearMod. This implementation is intentionally lightweight to unblock
 * compilation and can be expanded later if needed.
 *
 * Responsibilities (stubbed):
 * - Track whether BearMod and Mundo native libraries are "loaded"
 * - Provide a single entry point to load all required libraries
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Actual System.loadLibrary calls are typically handled centrally (e.g.,
 *   in BearApplication or a dedicated native initializer). To avoid double
 *   loading and conflicts, this stub only sets flags and logs.
